# 🧠 DOM Manipulation, Web Storage & JSON — My ALX Project

Welcome to my Week 8 ALX Front-End Web Development project! This one was all about building dynamic, interactive web applications using JavaScript. I dove deep into DOM manipulation, browser storage, and working with JSON data — and I came out with a fully functional quote generator that’s smarter than it looks.

## 🚀 Project Overview

I built a web app called **Dynamic Quote Generator** that lets users:
- View random quotes by category
- Add new quotes and categories
- Persist data using local and session storage
- Import/export quotes in JSON format
- Filter quotes dynamically
- Sync quotes with a mock server and resolve data conflicts

## 🧠 What I Learned

### ✅ DOM Manipulation
- Created and updated HTML elements dynamically
- Handled user interactions with event listeners
- Built forms and dropdowns on the fly

### ✅ Web Storage
- Used `localStorage` to persist quotes and filters
- Demonstrated `sessionStorage` for temporary preferences

### ✅ JSON Handling
- Exported quotes to a downloadable `.json` file
- Imported quotes from user-uploaded JSON files
- Managed quote data with consistency and integrity

### ✅ Filtering & Syncing
- Filtered quotes by category using a dynamic dropdown
- Saved filter preferences across sessions
- Simulated server sync with conflict resolution logic
